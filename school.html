            <p>For primary school I went to ST.Marys Ballygunner. It was a mixed school.It was a good school and I dont really remember much about it besides some of my friends from the school.For secondary school I went to De La Salle.I made alot of new friends in secondary school and it was pretty fun. At times it was hard but we got through it in the end.The subjects I did in secondary school from 1st to 3rd year were the common 3 everyone had to do and history,geography,woodwork,science,German and business.My favourite subject was woodwork because it was pretty easy.After the junior cert I decided to skip TY because some of my friends in other years told me it was a wasted of time and money and that was probably the best decision of my life.In 5th year I had to pick other subjects to do so I picked business,German,physics and geography.I wasnt the best at maths ,physics and german.I really enjoyed physics but I despised German.All of the teachers were nice but I just couldnt do German, when I was in German class my brain just turned off.For the leaving cert uhh I mean predicted grades my grades were pretty good id say, I was relieved when they said we were getting predicted grades because I didn't want to sit the exams.Now I'm in college at WIT in the Applied computing course and so far I'm enjoying it. </p>
