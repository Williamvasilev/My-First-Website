            <p>There is 5 people in my family me,my mom,my dad and my 2 brothers.I already introduced myself in the "about me" section so its time for me to introduce my family.My moms name in Nazgul and shes a really nice person, everyone loves her because shes so friendly and always works hard.My mom and me are really close.She works at Aldi on the cork road so she can easily pick me up after school when we actually have to be campus.My mom is from Kyrgastan, so many people dont know where it is so i'm just going to put up a picture of where it is.My mom is 44 years old.My dads name is Pavel and he works in security.He always travels for work and he works night shifts so he sleeps during the day so I dont really see him mich and when I do he just tells me to do chores in the house which im more that happy to help arounf the house.My dad is 41 years old.My older brother is Adam he is 19 and he was doing an apprentership in jaguar as a mechanic but then he got let go because of covid but as soon as things get better hes going back but currently he is working in aldo too on the tramore road.My younger brother is 2 and he doesn't do much besides doing baby things like eating, sleeping, crying and all that good stuff.He is really cute though.</p>
