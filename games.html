            <p>I also love playing games on my computer.I first started playing games on a PS2 when I was 5. I can't really remember what games i played on it. When I was 7 I got PS3 I loved it. The main game I played on it was COD Black ops 2, I loved playing that game with my friends. After 5 years I got a PC.At first I wanted a PS4 but thne my dad told me to get a PC because he said they were much better.At the time I was really sad but then I grew to love my PC and I prefer PCs way more to consoles now. If my dad never told me to get a PC I probably won't even be doing this course.My first computer wasn't the best but it did the job. I couldnt really run many programs or play ant of the high end games but I still had fun with my friends on it. After 3 years of using that computer I finally thought of getting an upgrade and I did, my current pc specs are R5 1600x 16GB ram RX580 8gb and a AX270 mother board.I built the computer myself and it took me 7 hours since it was my first PC buld, since then i've made many computers for my friends and family. </p>
