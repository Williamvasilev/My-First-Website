            <p>I love sports, I've been playing sports practically my whole life. When I was little I would always go outside and we would always play football in the pitch beside us. It was always good fun but as we got older we stopped playing and I joined a football club when i was 7 but i only did it for about a year, then after i left football i started doing MMA but i only did that for 3 weeks, yeah thats a very long time. My dad didnt really want me doing MMA so he made me join a boxing club. I was doing boxing with him since i was 4 but i never really joined a club until i was nearly 8. I did boxing for about 8 years with the club and 3 years with my dad so in total i've dobe 11 years of boxing. I stopped boxing when I was 15 because I was barely going to training anf I only really did it for the fitness at that point. I did have some fights in tournaments, I had 11 fights in total and I won 10 and lost 1.I was pretty good at boxing, well thats what I thought.After boxing I wanted to join a gym so that I can still have some type of excersise. I joined <a href="https://waterford.kingfisherclub.com/" target="_blank">Kingfisher</a> after the junior cert and I made alot of friends from the gym because alot of people there went to my school.Now i've been going gym for nearly 2 years now and im looking forward on going more with my friends.
